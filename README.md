# Overview
This project was focused on identifying the best analytical model (among K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Boosing & Bagging, Naive Bayes and Stepwise Logistic Regression) for predicting customer churn in telecommuincations. A secondary goal was to 
determine the best approach to handling missing data, comparing PPM, CART and LASSO imputation methods. The dataset for this model are largely categorical data. Interestingly, this project mirrors a real-world project to reduce long distance customer 
churn using various incentives completed when I worked for GTE Corporation / Verizon.
